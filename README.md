- 👋 Hi, I’m @dekkydog well Leo actually!
- 👀 I’m interested in highly creative design, beer, Chi-Gong and not taking life too seriously - but not neccessarily in that order.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a better human being.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that can utilise my core design skills (visual and UX design)
- 📫 Reach me - W: https://dropdeaddesign.co.uk E: leo@dropdeaddesign.co.uk
